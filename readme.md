I don't want to forget these feelings I can't explain  
So I'm breaking the norm, deleting the provided layout  
I'll sing my own song  
And send the words once locked within my breast to the sky  
These things I want to tell you  
The things I want to reach you  
May they converge together  
And reach out to you  
All these words I want to tell you  
And this song I want you to hear  
Everything is joined in a cirlce  
Joining us all together  
No matter where you may be  
This clear white light reminds me of your voice  
I felt it tumble into the palm of my hand  
It caused my finger to suddenly move along with the beat  
I'm setting all of these words into that rhythm and sending them to the heavens  
These things I want to tell you  
The things I want to reach you  
May they join a line  
That they may reach you, so far away from me  
These words I want to tell you  
And this song that I want you to hear  
They join together with other, ordinary things  
Connecting us all together  
No matter where we may be  
As I dance through these unchanging days  
I began to think that they are a gift given to us  
And that moment I believed, my world began to shake  
Tell me, I wanna know about your world! [Tell Your World]  
These things I want to tell you  
The things I that I want to reach you  
May they join into a line  
So they may reach you, so far away  
These words I want to tell you  
And the song I want you to hear  
They join together with other ordinary things  
Connecting us all to each other  
No matter how far away we may be..
